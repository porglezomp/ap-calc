Chapter 0 is composed of all of the basics of precalculus that most people forget. I won't go into very much detail on any of the topics, but I will at least list them.

Currently this is nothing but a block of headings, I'll add at least some description later.

## Functions

## Operations on Functions

### Arithmetic Operations on Functions

### Composition of Functions

## Families of Functions

## Inverse Functions

### Inverse Trigonometric Functions

## Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
