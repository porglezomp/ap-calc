# About this Book

This book is being written as notes for my AP Calculus class. I'm writing it down so I can clarify ideas to myself, and have them as useful, readable notes for later study. I hope that it can also prove to be a useful tool for others who are also studying Calculus.

## This Project

I'm trying to produce notes for many of my classes using github pages this year. You can see more at [my personal github page](https://porglezomp.github.io) and look at the source for this book at [its repository](https://github.com/porglezomp/ap-calc).
